For example, V7/\i may normally resolve to V either directly or indirectly. Ebmaj7 F-7 ·l The examples below show three cc=on deceptive root motion patterns from v7N. Imaj7 (V7/V) bIIImaj7 Ebmaj7 F7 Gbrnaj 7 Bmaj7 Emaj7 '1(1'5i1r1,l.,..

When this occurs, a pivot chord analysis becomes necessary since the dominant 7th chord assmnes a new meaning in the second key. The example below includes a pivot chord modulation from F to Ah. as well as several other deceptive resolutions of secondary dominants. Rootmotion patterns are typical. (V7 /VI) f-3 Ab: subV / I IF: Iraaj 7 . 7(bl3l maJ lz,, F. aj7 Cl Fm.ai 7 A7-------~ Abma j 7 Eb7 \, i t0 a i i ' f5' ii~'~b* -· v, _(b9) A" __Abmaj7 Dbrnaj 7 G 1 •• DmaJ / I@ba, 8 ' J,, , I ,,, ~ l l Abrnaj7 •• iI CHORD SCALES The chord scale for a deceptively resolving secondary dominant is derived from the parenthetical analysis, regardless of its resolution. This remains the rule. even in a modulation. In the preceding e;caowle, the A7 in the second measure takes a chord scale for V7NI (Mixolydian ~. li13 or altered), .not"Lydian brfor subV7/I. This application of chord scales reinforces the original meaning of the chord, and therefore POban= the deceptiveness of the resolution. Although occasional exceptions to this principle can be found, it is nearly always the most effective way to treat deceptive resolutions. Chapter 2 Harmony 4 6 CONTIGUOUS II V's ) The II V pattern is sometimes used in ascending rather than descending motion. When this occurs, functional analysis (Roman rnnnerals in a key) is no longer relevant. The chord progression is justified on the the basis of continuity and _repetition in the melody. harmony and root motion This is known as~ (_ "non-functional• analysis. In the following example. the E-7 A 7 pattern is contiguous to (or 'next to") the F-7 Bb7 pattern, but has no functional relationship to the other chords in the key of Eb. It is therefore called a CDntfguoas IT V. 1---Conc~guous--------------------------.1 _ --I I II-7 .V7/~Imaj7 I E-7 A7 -F'-7 Bb7 I Ebmaj7 A contiguous II V is usually a whole or half step away from another II V which is , analyzable in a key.

In the following example, the A7 is a half step away from the Bb..7. --Conticruous-------------------------.1 ° II-7 V7/l I Imaj7I E-7 A7 Bb-7 Eb7~Abmaj7 'Jllii, &l~ -• I .,ii1 h ';:; . 1,,; / 0 11 I• 9-cr-A contiguous II V may be interpolated in an otherwise functional progression.

As 17 in blues in C, however. it has tonic blues .imction. 17 is therefore a special function dominant seventh. A dominant seventh WI1i1 dominant function normally resolves directly or indirectly to another chord whose root is down a perfect 5th (arrow) or down a half step (dotted arrow). / --ol ,,,---,,,i Direct Resolution: I A-7 Ab7I G-7 Ci I Fmaj7 I I 1.,.___ ...J L---.J ~/ --'::.[ Indirect Resolution: I D-7 Dh7 I Db-7 Gh7 I Fmaj i I I t,. ___ .,.J L...--.J ~----d~ D-7 Db7 I G-7 C7 I Fmaj7 11 '----.J l..,___,,I Substitute dominant function is a kind of dominant function, and is not considered "'SJ)e'Ci.al.·4 • A chord with dominant function may also resolve deceptively without changing its fimctional analysis. F: (v7/VD (V7/V) sub\17/I ---------:,1,. ---~ I Fmaj7 A7 I Bbmaj7 G7 I G-7 Gb7 I Fmaj7 11 ,__ ---...l 17 and IV7 ~ftmdiao dominants, on the other hand. are not deceptive resolutions. 17in the blues soands like the tonic chord. and IV7 soands like the subdnminant chord. I7: Tonic blues ftmction IV7: Sabdaminaot blaes function IV7 is also diatonic to melodic minor, and has subdaminant function in that context as well. minor: IV?Melo~c Il'fl & '.§)n(:\& ' -e-0 S& ( ,.,~~; .;·-;,.. ~ gCh.apter 3 Harmony 4 The following examples use 17 and IV7: I7 IV?

The resulting vuicing was called an Italian augmented 6th chord, which;-spelled enharmonically, equals an A'rrfor b\117 in the key of C. IV bVI7 I 1 ) E'I A GIG 2) F/A Ab7 C/G , ' •I ,, " _.,_ ·~ I ~r-aug6 C C .I 6 6 .3 4 Chapter 3 Harmony 4 12 ln contemporary practice !J\117 can resolve to I in either root position or second inversion, but it must resolve to I.

The modal name for our major scale, for example, is 'Ionian", one of the medieval church modes. When we refer to 'modal" music. however, we mean music based on somewhat less familiar tonic mcxies. such as j Dorian or Phrygian. • MINORMOD~ A review of the comparisons among the standard minor scales (or modes) is a useful starting point. You will recall that the diatonic triads and seventh chords from all three tonic minor scales are freely interchangeable in minor key chord progressions.

These are traditional cbc.rrc:h modes. with names , from ancient Greek usage. frequently found in contemporary Western harmonic -practice. The modal quality of any of the less familiar modes is detennined by a dtamd:enstic note: the note in the scale whicb makes it different from natural minor (or different from Ionian for a major mode). Dmian: The cbaracteristic note of the Dorian mode is ~6. C Natural minor C Dorian ? 2 l I L , i> The Dorian mode is like a natural minor scale with a raised 6th.

'CJA' denotes a chord that contains the characteristic note, but is only sometimes modal sounding. Unlike standard minor key hannony, modal hannony does not use subdominant and dominant categories. The I chord is tonic and the others are non-tonic. Characteristic chords establish the modal flavor, and a resolution from a characteristic chord to I is a modal cadence. The diminisbP.d triad and the minor 7 (b5) chord are avoided in modal chord progressions, even when they contain the characteristic note. They are quite unstable, do not resolve effectively to I in these modes, and may imply the relative major key instead. The following progression establishes the sound of C Dorian effectively.

A modal key signature is the same as its relative major key signature (Bb Major for C Dorian). To avoid confusion, the name of the mode (eg: 'F Pbrygian') should be written along with a modal key signature. It is also possible, but probably time-consuming, to use no key signature and to add all appropriate accidentals before notes. PHRYGIAN:The characteristic note of the Pbrygian mode is b<z. C Natural minor C Phrygian l J' 2 ?

Therefore, a Phrygian I-7 chord takes tension 11 only. Hw=y ,i The characteristic notes of all three minor modes (Dorian, Pbrygian and Aeolian) are aYf1id notes on their I chords. We will !llake an exception for the Dorian mode here, but other modal voicing techniques must wait for "Advanced Modal Harmony". The mcxies are established harmonically with modal cadences. I • To voice a =,6, or tension 13,on the Dorianl-7, use an upper .tdnrl:Dn! l.riad. D  Dorian: I  E.o.7  0-7 (~D  ~ ~ D-7  D-7(ii)  - C  G  "J  <  -0-1  -P. -,  D-7  D-7  As illostrated above, a Dorian voicing can be created with an upper stnR:tare triad above the original chord. The first is a minor triad a whole step higher, and tbe secondis a major triad a perfect fourth higher. The chord symbols for upper stnR:tare triads can be called r.onvinand dJanl .,,....,_.,., A compound chord symbol with a .6o.iuutJ liDe, like the ones above, indicat.es a chord over a chord -two chords played simultaneotIS!y.

The Mixolydian mode's h-7is a chord tone on 17, and the Lydian's #4 becomes tension #11 on I major in any form.

A chord over a chord: Gb C7 A chord over a chord is called an upper structure triad or upper structure se~th chord. and the notes of the upper structure are interpreted as upper extentions of the chord below. (b 9 \ Gb Cl bS )C7 --61---.? --•1 C7 (no 5th) The example above is an upper structure triad voicing for C7 (~ 1This kind of voicing is sometimes called a "polychord". since it combines two chords v;bi.c,.'i can be heard both serparately and together as one voicing. Gb  G  c7  F  (triad)  '  '  '  13  ii :!.'1. q  -=  I  y  I  .  "~  - 3  5"  - :.  A chord over a chord is correctly written with a horizont.al dividing line. while a chord over a single bass note ases a diagonal line. I G/F ' c., However. this distinction is not universally observed. and it is useful to label a 10\\,-e structure that is a major triad: G F (triad) --l'. Ch.apt..r 7 Harn:iany '1 II. A chord over a bass note: Gb/C A chord over a single bass note is usually one of the foll()\\,ing: A .

Tne followingare all inversions of C-7: C-7/G C-ifBb (The chord~ has the same notes as C-7/Eb. so the specific interpretation must depend on the musical conte.t at the time). B. Ahybrid structure: Gbfc Vvnen tbe bass note is not the 3rd. 5th or 7th of the upper structure.. the . voicing is interpreted as a hybrid structure. The following example, C-~ is .not C-1over its 11th. because the ear does not perceive bass notes as tensions.

These voicings. then. are characteristically ambiguous sounding, because the 3rd would normally establish a major or minor quality, and would also create a tlitone for dominant 7th chords. The foilowing are some typical hybrids: (sus4)07 or G/C Cmaj7 A-7/0 D-7 Fmaj7 ( II11)Cmaj7/FI 1, '1 5 "'t, -9qtf-,I L/ 'I ~-.f1, :f, ANALYSIS OF COMPOUND CHORD SYltIBOLS The use of a compound chord symbol does not in any way change the functional analysis of the ~hord. If Ci is Vi in the key of F. then Gb and G¥C are also Y7 in the key ofF. • C7 Any inversion of C7, such as C7/G, also remains v7 in F. POLYCHORDS: A chord over a chord is analyzed in tenns of the function of the lower strm:ture. The upper structure simply represents tensions or extensions of the basic chord. The following progression is analyzed in C in terms of the lower structures. The lower structures do not contain 5th's. which are considered unnecessaiy unless altered. ~ C: Imaj7 V7/IV 1Vmaj7 bIImaj7 Imaj7G Gb E-7 =C=--~~ G Caiafi CT "'"F-(,.t:"'r'"'i-a"d') D tjma J 7 I I I wiiaJ7 .,I V ~C/~ .

The following example represents basically the same chord progression. but uses inversions instead of polychords. The sound is characteristically less complex. ,~ C: Imaj7 V7/IV IV b IImaj 7 Imaj7 Cmaj7/GC"/3J• -/ C4Bb F /1A Dbjllaj7/AbI _._I ~ ' -6'-'IV I -I I ' -The anaiysis aboveis the same as the analysis in ilie previous example because it is the same progression. Aliliough the .bass motion has changed. the root motion remains the same. and the chords are essentially of ilie same type. HYBRIDS: A chord over a single bass note iliat is not an inversion (3rd. 5th or 7th in the bass) is usually a hybrid. Therefore, ilie bass note shouid be considered the root. and the notes of the upper structure used to determine the chord type. In the following example, C is the root and the notes of the upper structure create a 5th, m<>jor7th and major 9th above the root. G/C " 1 I • •I i _;j Since the voicing contains no 3rd above C, it could be interpreted as either Cmaj7 or C-(maJ7)_ In most situations the more common Cmaj7 would be the obvious choice. but the overall hannonic context might indicate the atlemative. Because of the major 7th. it could not be interpreted as a dominant or minor 7th chord. Hru-rnony d ;o T!'1en~i.-cexa.rnpl~rrs.es rh~ sa..r-net.::ho.rdprc.~~sior ..... but ~vith all hybrici voici.i.1gs~ -~ C: Imaj 7 V7 /IV IVmaj 7 Imaj 7G/C Gb/C E-7/F G/CI • I I j_ Cr'I ~ V"' ' Each chord type in this progression is determined by the relationship of the upper structure notes t-0 the root. \Ve have seen that G/C equals a formula of 1. 5. 7. 9.

Either choice would be technically corred. 51O:tapter 7 H:annany .i Another area of ancertainty involves an exception to the in~ion rnle (referred to earlier). A major triad a whole step above the bass note (F!ED)has two alternative inteqiretations: 1) The inversion rnle would make it a dominant 7th with the 117th in the bass (F7); 2) the hybrid inteqiretation would give it a Lydian sound (Ebmajor Lydian or Ell7, Lydian trr). Again, the choice must bemade on the basis of musical context. The first exrunole beiow uses F/Eb as an inversion ofF7. The second uses the same compound chord S)mbol. and the same voicing. as a hybrid version of Eb major Lydian. ~ F: I V7/IV IV I 1/7 .

As always. t.'-ie harmonic ar1alysis dictates the choice of c}1ord scale. However. specific voicings for poly_<;hords and hybrids ofren indicate specific alternate chord scales. Our fLrst example. Llh or Ghtc.clearlv indicates an altered dominantC7 • sc..,le. even iS the chord is V7/I (in F) or V7/IV (in C). fa sumrnar{. tensions that are included in the voicing should also be included in the-chord scale.· Gb Cl(alt)CT Gb/Cd "!'1 ; ?2 ~ 6'b5 io ~6' t,9-7& ~6'7 l b9 3 b5 b7 ~ :f, The use cf L.,versions similar!v does not affect hannonic analvsis. Inversions are nearly al\>-ays used tc accommodate a stepwise bass line. but the .root motion stays the same even if the hass motion changes. \Vhen the 3rd or 7th of a chord is in the bass. however, altered tensions are difficult to use because they solllld more dissonant. In most cases. frlen. invert.ed chords sound best w:ith chord tones and natural tensions. Chapter 7 Hannony .1 53 HYBRIDCONSTRUCTION We have seen that it is possible to reduce a polychord to a hybrid: GhCcan become GllfCfor a more ambiguous, indefinite sound. -7 It is also possible to create a hybrid voicing from a simple chord symbol if the same effect is desired. A hybrid stroctnre always creates a sense of harmonic instability, but its effect may be either dissonant or bland, depending on the intervals within the voicing. It can be used in isolated situations, in combination with other compound chord symbols, or in a series of hybrids to create a very ambiguous sounding progression. A hybrid structure is made up of notes from the chord scale of the moment and retains the original root, but is indefinite sounding becaase it omits the 3rd of the chord. These principles are used in the following examples; the second is the same as the first except that some of the original chord symbols are replaced with hybrids. b9) (Ionian) ~ ( Lyd. b 7) __(_~or. l (Mixo.bl3) V7/III III-? subV7/II,· II-l V 7 / I ~l . lImaj7 ( ·g) maJ I !lb ffi2.J·7 A7(ll 9 l D7 7 Db7(lllll C-7 F7 D Bbmai7 . I III . • I I ( 1/9 ) f/Bb A7 bl3 D-7 Eb/Db G-7/C Eb-/F Bbmaj7 0 I A I I I I I ' . , -a.-6'.h9.1--z,'""" '--v.'-z:r-B .• ' I , I .' ' l r Olapter 7 Hannony 4 54 Proced111e The procedure for deriving hybrid voicings from simple chord symbols can be described as follows: l.

Relative dissonance or blandness is controlled by the intervals between the root and the notes of the upper structure. The procedure given aboveis followed in the following example: (Dor. l-(Mixo.)

This. however. would be unnecessarily complex, since they are exactiy the same as Dmaj7 and E-7 respectively. Therefore. compound chord symbols should be used only for specific harmonic techniques. L' 56Chapter 8 Harmony 4 CONSTANT STRUC,'TURE CHORD PROGRESSIONS A constant structure chord progression is a series of chords, all of the same type. Fmaj7 Bbmaj 7 Ebmaj7 Abmaj7 Dbmaj7 Gbmaj7 Fmaj7 I ; '2 njF)l~s. i&: I ~ 11 , ' 9J 0 In the example above, each chord is a major 7th chord. It is therefore a constant structure progression, and its analysis can be undertaken from two different perspectives. First, it is clearly a ftmctional chord progression in the key of F: ,1 F: Imaj7 IVmaj7 bVIImaj 7 bIIImaj7 bVImaj7 bIImaj7 Imaj-; Fmaj7 Bbmaj7 Ebmajl Abmaj7 Dbmaj7 Gbmaj7 FmajJ j . I r ' I ft 1/(j ibp &] 0 However, since all the chords are of the same type, and the root motion is a consistent inteival of descending perfect 5th's, the listener may hear the pattern of motion more clearly than harmonic ftmction in a key. The description of patterns and sequences in constant strncture progressions is called non-frmctionalanalysis. The following example can be analyzed both functionally and non-functionally: ~  C:  bIImaj7 Dbmaj7  Imaj7 Cmaj7 I  bVImaj7 Abmaj7 I  IVmaj7 Fmaj7 I  bIImaj7 Dbmaj7  _Imaj7 Cmaj7  )  V  •  '.  '  I  I  '-'  b--&. Chapter & Hannony 4 57 A non-functional analysis of the previous example would in.elude the following considerations: 1. It is a constant structure major seventh chord progression. 2. The root motion is in descending thirds. 3. The root motion spells a DCmaj7 chord, which is the cadential chord in the progression. 4. The melody emphasizes common tones between chards, creating a smooth, linking quality. 5. The same melody note becomes richer sounding on each chord. It starts as the 5th ofCmaj.7, and becomes the 7th, 9th and #11th on successive chards. Some constant structure progressions are purely non-ftmctional; this means that analysis within a key is difficult, if not impossible, and the real meaning or sound of the music lies in root motion patterns and melodic and rhythmic sequences. (Slow) r--Constant Structures----------------.C-7 Eb-7 D-7 F-7 I'"\ -I r--3---, I " r i I r I I I Ab:subV7/I Imaj7 ( #11) E-7• •A 7 ,.----,_. Abmaj 7 .....,...., I I c.--3 ' ' In this example, the first and second measures are almost identical: a melodic and harmonic sequence. The root motion pattern is up a minor third, then down a half-step. The E-7 acts as a pivot chord from non-ftmctional to functional harmony. It is the last of the constant structure minor 7th chords, and it becomes the related II-7 of A7(#1l). As in the example above, most non-functional progressions involve a statement (measure 1), a repetition (meastm! 2), and then a variation of some kind (measure 3). il .°'!lf'ter & Harmony A. 5& Tunes with constant structure sections nearly always contain familiar ftmctional harmony as well. Constant struct= passages usually end with root motion that is -, stepwise or down a perfect 5th. Constant structure progressioDll are usually made up of major or rumor seventh ,_ chords. Other chord types, although possible, are often considered either too unstable " or too bland for this Jund of harmonic motion. _ Root motion can be either one consistent interval (all 3rds or all 5ths), or a pattern of two or possibly three intervals (up a 3rd, then down a 5th). In the following example, the final interval is stepwise in order tc return to Eb: Ebmaj7 Gmaj7 C;na j 7 Emaj7 ~ I II P..maj 7 Ebmaj7 I ' I ' I I I
